TCP SYN flood攻击击的小程序linux上可以直接运行 
(TCP SYN flood attack to strike the applet can be run directly on linux)




A tool to perform SIP/SDP INVITE message flooding over UDP/IP. It was tested 
on a Linux Red Hat Fedora Core 4 platform (Pentium IV, 2.5 GHz), but it is 
expected this tool will successfully build and execute on a variety 
of Linux distributions.

This tool was produced with honorable intentions, which are: 
 
  o To aid owners of VoIP infrastructure to test, audit, and uncover security 
    vulnerabilities in their deployments. 
 
  o To aid 3rd parties to test, audit, and uncover security vulnerabilities 
    in the VoIP infrastructure of owners of said infrastructure who contract 
    with or otherwise expressly approve said 3rd parties to assess said 
    VoIP infrastructure. 
 
  o To aid producers of VoIP infrastructure to test, audit, and uncover security 
    vulnerabilities in the VoIP hardware/software/systems they produce. 
 
  o For use in collective educational endeavors or use by individuals for 
    their own intellectual curiosity, amusement, or aggrandizement - absent 
    nefarious intent. 
    
Unlawful use of this tool is strictly prohibited. 
 
The following open-source libraries of special note were used to build 
inviteflood: 
 
1) libnet v1.1.2.1 (tool requires at least this version) 
2) hack_library [utility routines - Str2IP( ) GetNextGuid( ) DumpPacket( ) ] 
   see www.hackingexposedvoip.com 
 
    Note: The Makefile for inviteflood presumes 
          that hack_library.o and hack_library.h reside in 
          a folder at ../hack_library relative to the Makefile 
          within the inviteflood directory. 
 
Install and build the libraries in accordance with their respective 
instructions. Then change to the inviteflood directory and type: make 
 
Appearing below is a SIP INVITE message with SDP payload output from the 
tool. The SDP is typical of that output from an Avaya 4602 phone circa 
Oct, 2004. The tool builds one INVITE message. The CSeq header field 
value is then incremented in each subsequent message and the new value 
is also used to replace the last 10 characters of the following header 
field values: 
 
the Via branch tag 
the From tag 
the Call-ID 
 
A change in these values influence the targeted UA server to interpret 
each INVITE message as an independent call dialog initiation event, 
as opposed to a redundant request. For speed reasons, the update to the 
ID/tags are performed "in-place" (i.e. the SIP/SDP message content does 
not have to be synthesized each time). 
 
Message injection occurs at layer 3 (i.e. SDP/SIP/UDP/IP layer). The 
size of the resulting layer 2 packet varies depending upon the command 
line inputs, but generally ends up being approximately 1140 bytes 
(Ethernet II).

Make the makefile you find in the same directory as this Readme.txt 
file and you should be ready to go. There might be some warnings 
dependent upon the compiler vintage. 
 
This version of the tool is transmit only. It is incapable of responding 
to authentication challenges or call dialog handshaking. The storm of 
signaling messages is actually worsened by not responding to call dialog 
handshaking from the targeted SIP network agents. They retry. 
         
inviteflood - Version 2.0 
              June 09, 2006 
 Usage: 
 Mandatory - 
        interface (e.g. eth0) 
        target user (e.g. "" or john.doe or 5000 or "1+210-555-1212") 
        target domain (e.g. enterprise.com or an IPv4 address) 
        IPv4 addr of flood target (ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd) 
        flood stage (i.e. number of packets) 
 Optional - 
        -a flood tool "From:" alias (e.g. jane.doe) 
        -i IPv4 source IP address [default is IP address of interface] 
        -S srcPort  (0 - 65535) [default is well-known discard port 9] 
        -D destPort (0 - 65535) [default is well-known SIP port 5060] 
        -l lineString line used by SNOM [default is blank] 
        -s sleep time btwn INVITE msgs (usec) 
        -h help - print this usage 
        -v verbose output mode 
 
The invocation of the tool producing the SIP message above was: 
 
./inviteflood  eth0  5000  proxy1.enterprise1.com  10.1.101.10  1000000 
 
This invocation might actually target multiple SIP network agents. For  
example, if 10.1.101.10 is the SIP Proxy server. 1,000,000 requests to 
INVITE the VoIP phone at x5000 into a call are sent to the SIP Proxy server. 
How the SIP Proxy server responds is usually a function of whether 
authentication is enabled in the 10.1.101.10 domain. In an unauthenticated 
domain, the a SIP Proxy server usually modifies each INVITE request and 
forwards it on to the phone at extension x5000. In an authenticated network, 
the SIP Proxy server usually challenges the flood tool. So, in an 
unauthenticated domain, the SIP proxy and the VoIP phone are both flooded. 
 
Since no -a option was specified, no username appeared in the From URI 
or the Contact header lines. 
 
Since no -i option was specified, the source IP address defaulted to 
10.1.101.11 (i.e. in this case, the eth0 IP address of the PC running 
the inviteflood tool). 
 
Since no -S option was specified, the source port defaulted to 9. 
 
Since no -D option was specified, the source port defaulted to the well-known 
SIP port of 5060. 
 
Since no -l (i.e. lower case L) option was specified, the line= parm was not 
added to the Request line. 
 
From some non-robust statistical observations, the flood rate had a 
fairly wide variance. The output rate from a single instance of the 
inviteflood tool running on a Pentium IV, 2.6 GHz, 512 MB RAM PC averaged 
about 10 KHz, but burts were observed up to 100 KHz. With two instances 
of the inviteflood tool running, the average rate was about 20 KHz. The rate 
seemed to drop with three instances of the tool running. In any case, 
the Ethernet switch used might have been moderating the flood. During a burst 
of messages at 100 KHz, it seemed that messages were being presented to 
the SIP Proxy at about 10 KHz (at least as noted by an ethereal capture 
on the Proxy Server). It should be emphasized these were casual observations.
